## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I really appreciated the various approaches to asking questions. I find that I tend to ask as soon as I have a questions, and feel that I would benefit from troubleshooting and saying the questions out loud, wording it very specifically with examples before finally pulling the trigger to ask. I also ordered a "rubber ducky" for out loud problem solving.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
* I prefer puts, because it is easier for me to read -prints out on a second line, as opposed to print, which prints it on the same line. That is why all of my exercises were done with puts instead of print

 `puts "Hello World!"`

 `print "Hello World!"`

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
* The octothorpe aka pound character #

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
* An integer is any positive or negative whole number, a float is any positive or negative number with decimals

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`puts "#{animal}"`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
* An interpolation is sticking data in the middle of a string

`puts "#{animal} mussel is an invasive species found in Eurasia found to harm native species of that area."`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
* `gets.chomp`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
* .reverse
* .gsub
