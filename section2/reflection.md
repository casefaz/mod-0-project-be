## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
+ S.M.A.R.T. goals - specific, measureable, acheivable, relevant, time-bound (article)
+ When you want to give up, remember the struggle is normal and good - it doesn't make you a bad developer (video)

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I really appreciated both the video and the article as I struggle with not giving up, or asking questions immediately when I don't get something right away. They both highlighted the value in struggling and how it's a sign of learning and growth. I also like how closely related to meditation the growth mindset is.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
-
```Ruby
book = 11

if book <= 9
  p "not enough book"
elsif book == 11
  p "just enough book"
elsif book >= 12
  p "WOW, look at all them book"
end

```

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
* in order to control conditional instructions, or instructions that change depending on the input/answer

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```Ruby
if
  puts " "
end
```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
- using `else` and `elsif`
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```Ruby
if
  puts " "
elsif
  puts " "
else
   puts
end
```
